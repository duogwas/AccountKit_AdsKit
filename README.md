# Ads Kit: 
Ads Kit leverages the vast user base of Huawei devices and Huawei's extensive data capabilities to provide you with the Publisher Service, helping you monetize traffic. Meanwhile, it provides the advertising service for advertisers to deliver personalized campaigns or commercial ads to Huawei device users.
